# zxarray

## Description

zxarray is an interface of zarr similar to xarray.  The idea is to benefit from
the advantages of xarray (coordinate access, parallel apply), while keeping
memory usage low by storing data in zarr. To achieve this:
- zxarray.ZXArray have accessors similar to those of xarray, such as `.loc`,
  `.sel`, `.isel`.
- an `apply_ufunc` function calling the xarray function enables parallel
  calculation via dask.


## Install

zxarray can be installed via pip:

~~~bash
pip install zxarray
~~~
